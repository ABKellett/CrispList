# CrispList
A Flutter app to help users in planning, shopping, and tracking their grocery foods with a goal to reduce food waste and save money. Backend in Google Firebase. Capstone Project in Fall 2022.

###Project Context

This project was conceived, designed, and coded as my individual capstone project during the last semester of my master's degree. Between using a tech stack I had never used before (Flutter, Firebase Auth and Firestore -- a NoSQL database) and juggling the rest of my courseload, completing this project was a rewarding challenge. Despite any imperfections, I learned a lot and plan to continue to work on this project independently.
